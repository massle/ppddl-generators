A simple Solitaire variant where cards must be moved in a particular order into their home piles. There are additional stacks, where one can buffer cards following the usual rules. Initially, each such stack contains just a single card, which ensures the existence of a proper policy. Additional cards can be drawn from a deck, which draws a card uniformly at random. The drawn card can then either be moved to its home pile, in case its predecessor card has already been placed there, or can be moved to the buffer stacks, in case this is possible as per the typical solitaire constraints. Alternatively, there is also the possibility to redraw another card at a very high cost. Each card can be taken out of the deck at most once, zero times for those placed initially on a stack. In order to optimize cost, one wants to utilize the stack buffers in the best possible way (avoiding costly redrawing). However, when not building the stacks carefully enough, there is the potential of running into dead ends.
