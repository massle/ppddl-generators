Extension of the transport domain from IPCs 2008 onwards. We build on the original (classical) PDDL generator from the [pddl-generators](https://github.com/AI-Planning/pddl-generators/tree/main/transport) collection.

The probabilistic version follows extensions similar to what has been proposed before for NoMystery, Rovers, and TPP. Resembling the Canadian travelers problems, the probabilistic version contains uncertainty about the road network, where some roads might not be available. Whether a road is available can only be observered when being adjacent to it.
