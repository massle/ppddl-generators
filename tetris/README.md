A tetris variant where after each turn the type of the next tile is chosen uniformly at random. The planner's task is to place all tiles on a grid, where "all" is a controlled parameter N (total number of tiles to place). To ensure that there is always a proper solution (assuming that the grid size and total number of tiles parameters are chosen appropriately), there is the possibility to redraw the type of the next tile at a very high cost. Dead ends arise if space is managed poorly, as at some point, it will just not possible to place all remaining tiles no matter of the type of the tiles. The script also comes with an additional parameter allowing to control the initial population of the grid (i.e., allowing to start from different gamesÂ states).
